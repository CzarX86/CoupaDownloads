# PR 14 â€” Deep cleanup and repository reorganization

Status: Partially implemented (docs structure created; key docs moved into `docs/`; legacy indexed).

Highlights:
- Added `docs/` with subfolders: `platform/`, `howto/`, `reports/`.
- Moved selected root Markdown files into `docs/` and created model/documentation indexes.
- Added `archive/legacy/README.md` placeholder for the upcoming move of `Legacy and Test Files/`.

No code imports were changed. Further moves can proceed incrementally.
