## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When headless mode configuration conflicts occur (e.g., environment variable vs interactive setup), what should be the precedence rule? ‚Üí A: Remove environment variable, interactive setup only
- Q: When headless mode fails to initialize (e.g., browser doesn't support headless), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: C + D (Retry once, then prompt user to choose)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator running the CoupaDownloads automation in a server environment or CI/CD pipeline, I need to execute the EXPERIMENTAL subproject in headless mode so that the browser automation can run without requiring a graphical interface, enabling automated execution in headless environments and reducing system resource consumption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user selects headless mode in the interactive setup, **When** the automation is executed, **Then** the browser should launch in headless mode without displaying any graphical interface
2. **Given** the user sets headless mode to true in the interactive setup, **When** processing begins, **Then** all browser operations should execute invisibly while maintaining full functionality
3. **Given** the system is running in a headless environment (e.g., CI/CD server), **When** the automation script is executed, **Then** it should complete successfully without requiring display capabilities
4. **Given** headless mode is enabled, **When** multiple parallel browser processes are spawned, **Then** each process should respect the headless configuration consistently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when headless mode is requested but the system doesn't support it? ‚Üí System retries once, then prompts user to choose visible mode or stop
- How does the system handle browser crashes or timeouts in headless mode? ‚Üí Same recovery mechanisms as visible mode
- What occurs when the user changes headless preference mid-session? ‚Üí Takes effect for subsequent browser initializations

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST honor the headless mode setting from interactive setup when initializing browser instances
- **FR-002**: System MUST consistently apply headless mode configuration across all browser initialization points in the EXPERIMENTAL subproject
- **FR-003**: Interactive setup wizard MUST allow users to configure headless mode preference
- **FR-004**: System MUST pass the headless configuration parameter to all browser manager initialization calls
- **FR-005**: Process worker functions MUST respect headless mode when creating isolated browser instances
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain identical functionality between headless and non-headless execution modes
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear feedback when headless mode is enabled during execution
- **FR-008**: Browser configuration MUST apply appropriate headless browser arguments when headless mode is active
- **FR-009**: System MUST retry headless initialization once if it fails, then prompt user to choose between visible mode or stopping execution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Browser Configuration**: Represents the settings that control whether browsers launch visibly or invisibly, set exclusively through interactive setup user preferences
- **Process Workers**: Individual execution contexts that spawn their own browser instances and must independently honor headless settings
- **Interactive Setup**: Configuration wizard that collects user preferences including headless mode preference

## Constitutional Compliance Check
*Required by CoupaDownloads Constitution v1.0.0*

### I. Documentation-Driven Development
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: This specification follows the required Proposal ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Report workflow
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: Technical decisions will be captured in ADRs if architectural impact is identified during design phase
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: Documentation maintains English technical interface descriptions while serving enterprise stakeholders

### II. Automation Reliability  
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: FR-002 and FR-006 directly address the constitutional requirement for consistent configuration propagation across execution modes
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: FR-007 ensures graceful handling and clear feedback for headless mode operations
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: All requirements support deterministic, resumable browser automation workflows

### III. Security by Design
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: Headless mode enhancement maintains existing security policies for browser profile isolation
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: No credential handling or sensitive data exposure in scope
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: Browser automation continues to respect corporate security policies regardless of visibility mode

### IV. Human-in-the-Loop Validation
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: Headless mode does not impact existing human review workflows for PO validation
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: Audit trail capabilities maintained in both headless and visible modes
- [x] **NOT APPLICABLE**: This is a configuration fix that doesn't affect business decision workflows

### V. Quality Assurance Standards
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: FR-006 ensures identical functionality between modes, following QA standards
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: End-to-end testing required per constitutional mandate for browser automation changes
- [x] **COMPLIANT**: No breaking changes to public contracts (CLI interfaces remain unchanged)

**Overall Constitutional Compliance**: ‚úÖ PASS - No violations detected
