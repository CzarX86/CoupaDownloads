# Feature Specification: Fix Parallel Workers

**Feature Branch**: `002-fix-asyncronous-multiple`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fix asyncronous/multiple workers. need to fix parallel/asyncronous processing in subproject since the edge profile is importante and there's a limitation in terms of running multiple workers with a single profile there're different possible approaches. 1 - execute parallel processing using tabs from a single window. tab state strict management is required. Risky since errors in a process can break multiple instances 2 - create a temporary copy of the profile for each worker. seems to be the best and safer allternative. 3 - try to find a workaround to reuse profise with multiple workers. I've tried extensively without success. the rest of the workflow and logic remains untourched. just parallel processing is implemented."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When the system scales to maximum worker count, what should happen if system resources (memory, CPU) become constrained? ‚Üí A: Automatically reduce worker count to maintain system stability (monitor performance to get back to initial number of workers or optimal number of workers if possible)
- Q: What level of browser profile isolation is required between workers? ‚Üí A: Complete temporary profiles (cookies, cache, extensions, all data isolated)
- Q: When a worker fails during PO processing, how should the system handle the incomplete task? ‚Üí A: Automatically retry failed task with a different worker + Attempt restart of failed worker before reassigning task
- Q: What constitutes "significant performance improvement" for parallel processing validation? ‚Üí A: Every additional worker should reduce total processing time by 1/N (N=number of workers)
- Q: How should the system handle potential download filename conflicts when multiple workers process POs simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Use file locking to prevent simultaneous downloads of same file + Existing logic sufficient (use PO locking based on the input.csv file. if one worker is working on a particular PO#, it should be locked for other workers to select it)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator processing large batches of Purchase Orders (POs), I need the EXPERIMENTAL subproject to process multiple POs simultaneously using parallel workers to significantly reduce processing time while maintaining data integrity and avoiding browser profile conflicts that currently prevent concurrent execution.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a batch of 20 POs to process, **When** I enable parallel processing with multiple workers, **Then** the system should process all POs concurrently without browser profile conflicts and complete the batch in significantly less time than sequential processing.

2. **Given** parallel processing is active with multiple workers, **When** one worker encounters an error or fails, **Then** other workers should continue processing unaffected and the failed worker's tasks should be recoverable.

3. **Given** the existing EXPERIMENTAL workflow and logic, **When** parallel processing is implemented, **Then** all current functionality (download locations, file organization, logging, reporting) should remain unchanged except for the addition of concurrent execution.

### Edge Cases
- **Profile Conflicts**: Resolved through complete temporary profile isolation per FR-002
- **Resource Exhaustion**: System automatically reduces worker count when memory/CPU constraints detected per PR-004, monitors performance to restore optimal worker count when resources available
- **Worker Failures**: System attempts to restart failed worker first, then automatically retries incomplete task with different worker if restart fails per FR-007
- **Download Conflicts**: PO-level locking based on input CSV prevents multiple workers from selecting same PO number; file locking prevents simultaneous downloads of same file per FR-008
- **Performance Scaling**: Each additional worker expected to reduce total processing time by 1/N (linear scaling) where N is number of workers per PR-001

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enable parallel processing of multiple POs simultaneously to reduce total processing time
- **FR-002**: System MUST resolve browser profile conflicts by creating complete temporary profiles (cookies, cache, extensions, all data isolated) for each worker
- **FR-003**: System MUST isolate workers to prevent errors in one worker from affecting others
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve all existing workflow and logic while adding parallel processing capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain current download directory structure and file organization during parallel execution
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide configurable worker count with automatic reduction when system resources become constrained, monitoring performance to return to optimal worker count when possible
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle worker failures gracefully by attempting to restart the failed worker, and if unsuccessful, automatically retry the incomplete task with a different worker
- **FR-008**: System MUST ensure data integrity by implementing PO-level locking based on input CSV file, preventing multiple workers from processing the same PO number simultaneously, and using file locking to prevent simultaneous downloads of the same file
- **FR-009**: System MUST clean up resources (browser profiles, processes, temporary files) when workers complete or fail
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing headless mode and other configuration options

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: Parallel processing MUST provide linear performance scaling where each additional worker reduces total processing time by 1/N (N=number of workers) for batches of 5+ POs
- **PR-002**: System MUST support at least 4 concurrent workers without resource exhaustion or instability
- **PR-003**: Worker initialization time MUST be reasonable (under 30 seconds per worker) to maintain usability
- **PR-004**: System MUST monitor resource utilization and automatically adjust worker count to maintain system stability (CPU usage <80%, memory usage <90%) while maximizing throughput

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Worker**: Individual processing unit that handles PO downloads with completely isolated temporary browser profile (cookies, cache, extensions, all data) and execution context
- **WorkerPool**: Container that manages multiple workers, coordinates task distribution, handles worker lifecycle, and automatically adjusts worker count based on resource constraints and performance monitoring
- **ProfileManager**: Component responsible for creating, managing, and cleaning up complete temporary browser profiles (full isolation) for each worker
- **TaskQueue**: Distribution mechanism that assigns PO processing tasks to available workers, implements PO-level locking to prevent duplicate processing, and tracks completion status
- **ProcessingSession**: Overall parallel processing session that coordinates workers, tracks progress, manages resources, and implements worker restart and task retry logic
- **ResourceMonitor**: Component that monitors system resources (CPU, memory) and triggers worker count adjustments to maintain optimal performance and system stability
