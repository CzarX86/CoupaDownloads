# Implementation Plan: Fix Parallel Workers

**Branch**: `002-fix-asyncronous-multiple` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-fix-asyncronous-multiple/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enable parallel processing for PO downloads in the EXPERIMENTAL subproject by implementing worker isolation through temporary browser profile copies. This resolves the current browser profile conflicts that prevent multiple workers from running concurrently, providing significant performance improvement for batch processing while preserving all existing workflow and logic.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12  
**Primary Dependencies**: Selenium WebDriver, Microsoft Edge, Poetry package management, multiprocessing  
**Storage**: File system (temporary browser profiles, download directories)  
**Testing**: pytest with existing test infrastructure, contract tests, integration tests  
**Target Platform**: macOS/Windows desktop (where Edge browser is available)  

**Project Type**: single - EXPERIMENTAL subproject enhancement  
**Performance Goals**: Linear scaling (1/N reduction per worker), support 4+ concurrent workers  
**Constraints**: Complete browser profile isolation required, worker initialization <30 seconds, maintain backward compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Enhancement to existing EXPERIMENTAL subproject, maintains all current functionality

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ Documentation-Driven Development**: Following Proposal → Design → Implementation → Report workflow via .specify templates; Architecture decisions captured in design contracts for lasting impact; Clarifications completed with comprehensive Session 2025-09-29

**✅ Automation Reliability**: Enhancement maintains deterministic, resumable, fail-safe automation; Browser automation handles network interruptions and session failures gracefully through worker isolation and restart mechanisms; Configuration changes propagated consistently across parallel and sequential execution modes

**✅ Security by Design**: No credential handling changes; Complete temporary profiles provide enhanced isolation; Maintains existing security policies and profile isolation standards; No PII exposure in parallel processing logs

**✅ Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: No changes to critical business decision workflows; Maintains existing audit trails and approval paths for procurement processes; Parallel processing transparent to business logic validation workflows

**✅ Quality Assurance Standards**: Follows PEP 8 with type hints; Comprehensive test coverage for parallel processing paths including contracts and integration tests; Browser automation changes validated through complete end-to-end flows; Maintains backward compatibility with existing interfaces

**Initial Constitution Check**: ✅ PASS - No violations detected  
**Post-Design Constitution Check**: ✅ PASS - All clarifications integrated, design compliant

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: Completed - research.md generated with comprehensive technology analysis

**Research Completed**:
- **Worker Architecture**: Analyzed multiprocessing vs threading vs asyncio approaches → Selected multiprocessing.Pool for isolation and stability
- **Profile Management**: Researched browser profile isolation techniques → Selected temporary profile copying with tempfile.mkdtemp()
- **Task Distribution**: Evaluated queue management patterns → Selected simple queue with PO-level locking
- **Error Handling**: Researched failure recovery strategies → Selected worker restart + task retry pattern
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyzed resource monitoring approaches → Selected dynamic worker scaling based on system metrics
- **Testing Strategy**: Established contract testing + integration testing approach for parallel processing validation
- **Integration Points**: Mapped existing EXPERIMENTAL architecture for minimal disruption

**Output**: ✅ research.md with 7 research areas completed, all technical decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: Completed - all design artifacts generated with comprehensive API contracts

**Design Artifacts Completed**:
1. **Data Model** (data-model.md): 6 core entities with complete business rules and relationships
2. **API Contracts** (contracts/ directory):
   - WorkerPool API contract with lifecycle management
   - ProfileManager API contract with temporary profile isolation
   - ProcessingSession API contract with MainApp integration
   - TaskQueue API contract with retry logic and thread safety
3. **Validation Scenarios** (quickstart.md): 6 comprehensive test scenarios covering:
   - Sequential baseline testing
   - Basic parallel processing validation
   - Profile isolation verification
   - Error handling and fallback testing
   - Performance measurement and scaling
   - Integration with existing workflow
4. **Agent Context Update**: Updated AGENTS.md, copilot-instructions.md, and GEMINI.md with parallel processing capabilities

**Constitutional Compliance**: ✅ PASS - All design artifacts follow documentation-driven development, maintain automation reliability, preserve security requirements

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, contracts/*.md, quickstart.md, updated agent context files

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - this section remains empty*

All design decisions align with constitutional principles:
- Documentation-driven development followed throughout
- Automation reliability enhanced through worker isolation
- Security by design maintained with profile isolation
- Human-in-the-loop validation workflows preserved
- Quality assurance standards met with comprehensive testing approach
