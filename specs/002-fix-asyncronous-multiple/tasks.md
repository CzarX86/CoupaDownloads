# Tasks: Fix Parallel Workers

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-fix-asyncronous-multiple/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅ required), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Python 3.12, Selenium WebDriver, Microsoft Edge, Poetry, multiprocessing
   → Structure: EXPERIMENTAL subproject enhancement with new workers/ module
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 7 entities with complete business rules and relationships
   → contracts/: 4 API contracts (worker_pool, profile_manager, task_queue, processing_session)
   → quickstart.md: 6 validation scenarios for comprehensive testing
3. Generated tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, exception handling
   → Tests: contract tests (4), integration tests (6), unit tests (6)
   → Core: models (6), workers module implementation (4)
   → Integration: MainApp integration, browser enhancement, configuration
   → Polish: documentation, performance validation, cleanup
4. Task rules applied:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential dependencies
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Tasks numbered T001-T037
6. Parallel execution groups identified
7. Dependencies mapped for execution order
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Target**: EXPERIMENTAL/ subproject enhancement
- **New module**: EXPERIMENTAL/workers/ for parallel processing components
- **Enhanced**: EXPERIMENTAL/core/ and EXPERIMENTAL/corelib/ for integration

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- **Setup** (T001-T004) → **Contract Tests** (T005-T008) → **Core Models** (T019-T022) → **WorkerPool** (T023-T025) → **ProcessingSession** (T026-T027) → **MainApp Integration** (T028-T029)

### Parallel Groups
1. **Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel after T001
2. **Contract Tests**: T005-T008 can run in parallel (different files)
3. **Integration Tests**: T009-T014 can run in parallel (different files)  
4. **Unit Tests**: T015-T018 can run in parallel (different files)
5. **Core Models**: T019-T022 can run in parallel (different classes)
6. **Documentation**: T032, T034 can run in parallel with T033

### Blocking Dependencies
- All tests (T005-T018) MUST complete before any implementation (T019-T035)
- T019-T022 (models) must complete before T023-T025 (WorkerPool implementation)
- T021-T022 must complete before T026-T027 (ProcessingSession needs TaskQueue and ProfileManager)
- T026-T027 must complete before T028-T029 (MainApp integration needs ProcessingSession)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Contract Tests (Run Together)
```bash
# Launch T005-T008 simultaneously:
poetry run python -m pytest tests/contract/test_worker_pool_contract.py &
poetry run python -m pytest tests/contract/test_profile_manager_contract.py &
poetry run python -m pytest tests/contract/test_task_queue_contract.py &
poetry run python -m pytest tests/contract/test_processing_session_contract.py &
wait
```

### Core Models (Run Together)
```bash
# After tests pass, implement T019-T022 in parallel:
# Different developers can work on different files simultaneously
Task: "WorkerInstance model in EXPERIMENTAL/workers/worker_pool.py"
Task: "ProcessingTask model in EXPERIMENTAL/workers/task_queue.py"  
Task: "ProfileManager class in EXPERIMENTAL/workers/profile_manager.py"
Task: "TaskQueue class in EXPERIMENTAL/workers/task_queue.py"
```

### Integration Tests (Run Together)
```bash
# Validate implementation with T009-T014:
poetry run python -m pytest tests/integration/parallel/ -v
```

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before implementation complete*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T008)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T019-T022 for 4 main entities)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files verified)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path (all paths included)
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task (verified by file paths)
- [x] Quickstart scenarios covered by integration tests (T009-T014)
- [x] Performance requirements addressed (T013, T033)
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained (T028 MainApp enhancement + T036 validation)
- [x] Resource cleanup handled (T035)
- [x] Resource monitoring implemented (T037 ResourceMonitor)

## Notes
- Total tasks: 37 (7 setup, 14 tests, 8 core implementation, 4 integration, 4 polish)
- Estimated parallel groups: 6 groups can run concurrently where marked [P]
- TDD approach: 14 test tasks must pass before 14 implementation tasks
- Backward compatibility: Existing EXPERIMENTAL functionality preserved (validated by T036)
- Performance target: Linear scaling (1/N reduction per worker) validated in T013, T033

## Implementation Status Summary (Updated)

### ✅ PHASE 3.5 POLISH COMPLETE - All 37 tasks completed successfully!

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Complete parallel processing implementation in EXPERIMENTAL/workers/
- ✅ All contract tests, integration tests, and unit tests passing
- ✅ WorkerPool, ProfileManager, TaskQueue, ProcessingSession fully functional
- ✅ MainApp enhanced with backward-compatible parallel processing support
- ✅ ResourceMonitor implemented with real-time system monitoring
- ✅ Import structure fixed - all EXPERIMENTAL scripts can run directly
- ✅ Documentation updated with parallel processing features
- ✅ Performance validation complete - linear scaling achieved

**ResourceMonitor Note:**
Core functionality works (worker registration, status tracking, resource monitoring). Export now avoids hangs by using a re-entrant lock and temporarily stopping the monitoring thread before collecting summary data.

**Final Status:** Phase 3.5 implementation is complete and ready for production use. All 37 tasks delivered with comprehensive parallel processing capabilities for CoupaDownloads.
