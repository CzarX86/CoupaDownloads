# Feature Specification: Incremental CSV Handler for CoupaDownloads

**Feature Branch**: `007-fix-csv-handler`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fix CSV handler - Precisamos implementar um sistema robusto de atualiza√ß√£o incremental do arquivo CSV para o projeto CoupaDownloads. O problema cr√≠tico atual √© que as informa√ß√µes processadas s√≥ s√£o escritas no input.csv ao final de todo o processo, causando perda total de dados em caso de falhas."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: Critical data loss issue in CSV processing system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: System operators, Background workers
   ‚Üí Actions: Process POs, Update CSV records, Persist data
   ‚Üí Data: CSV file with PO records and processing status
   ‚Üí Constraints: Concurrent access, Data integrity, Fault tolerance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum concurrent workers count]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Expected file size limits and performance targets]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: Operator processes POs with immediate persistence
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on data persistence and recovery
6. Identify Key Entities: CSV Record, Processing Status, Worker Session
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Marked performance and concurrency ambiguities
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: When multiple workers try to write to the CSV simultaneously, how should write conflicts be handled? ‚Üí A: Write queue (serialize all writes)
- Q: How often should the system create automatic backups of the CSV file? ‚Üí A: Before each processing session starts
- Q: When the system restarts after a crash, how should it identify which POs still need processing? ‚Üí A: Check both STATUS and timestamp (every entry not COMPLETED)
- Q: What should happen if a CSV write operation fails due to disk space or file system errors? ‚Üí A: Retry 3 times then log error and continue processing
- Q: For the remaining performance target clarification, what is the expected CSV file size the system should handle efficiently? ‚Üí A: Up to 10,000 POs (medium batches)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a CoupaDownloads operator, I need the system to immediately save PO processing results to the CSV file so that I can safely resume operations from any interruption point without losing hours of work.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a CSV file with 446 unprocessed POs, **When** the system processes the first PO successfully, **Then** that PO's status must be immediately written to the CSV file before processing the next PO
2. **Given** the system is processing POs in parallel mode, **When** multiple workers complete PO processing simultaneously, **Then** all results must be safely written to the CSV without data corruption
3. **Given** the system crashes while processing PO #200 of 446, **When** the operator restarts the system, **Then** the system must resume processing from PO #201 with all previous results intact
4. **Given** a PO processing fails with an error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the error details must be immediately written to the CSV file before continuing to the next PO

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the CSV file is locked by another process during write operation?
- How does the system handle concurrent writes from multiple worker processes?
- What happens if the disk is full during a CSV write operation?
- How does the system recover if the CSV file becomes corrupted during a write?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST write PO processing results to CSV immediately after each PO is processed, not at the end of the entire batch
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all previously processed PO data when operations are interrupted or fail
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow operators to resume processing from the exact point of interruption without reprocessing completed POs
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle concurrent CSV writes from multiple worker processes using a write queue to serialize all writes and prevent data corruption or loss
- **FR-005**: System MUST create automatic backups of the CSV file before each processing session starts
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate CSV file integrity after each write operation
- **FR-007**: System MUST record detailed error information in the CSV when PO processing fails
- **FR-008**: System MUST identify which POs remain unprocessed by checking both STATUS field (any value other than COMPLETED) and LAST_PROCESSED timestamp in the CSV
- **FR-009**: System MUST support both sequential (single-threaded) and parallel (multi-worker) processing modes with identical data persistence behavior
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain CSV encoding (UTF-8) and delimiter (semicolon) format consistency throughout all operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide progress tracking by showing how many POs have been processed out of the total
- **FR-012**: System MUST complete CSV write operations efficiently for files containing up to 10,000 POs, with each individual write operation completing within 5 seconds
- **FR-013**: System MUST retry failed CSV write operations up to 3 times, then log the error and continue processing other POs without halting the entire system

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CSV Record**: Represents a single PO with input data (PO_NUMBER, SUPPLIER, Priority, etc.) and processing status fields (STATUS, ATTACHMENTS_FOUND, ATTACHMENTS_DOWNLOADED, etc.)
- **Processing Status**: Tracks the current state of a PO (PENDING, COMPLETED, ERROR, NO_ATTACHMENTS) with timestamp and error details
- **Worker Session**: Represents an active processing unit that can update CSV records, including session ID and processing queue assignment
