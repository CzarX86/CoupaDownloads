# Tasks: Parallel Default Profile Loading & Cloning for Multiple Windows

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-parallel-profile-clone/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Tech stack: Python 3.12, Selenium WebDriver >=4.0.0, Microsoft Edge, multiprocessing, tenacity, structlog
   → Structure: EXPERIMENTAL subproject focus
2. Load design documents ✓
   → data-model.md: ProfileManager, WorkerProfile, VerificationConfig, etc.
   → contracts/: profile_manager_contract.py, worker_integration_contract.py
   → quickstart.md: Test scenarios and integration examples
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Dependencies, project structure, configuration
   → Tests: Contract tests, unit tests, integration tests
   → Core: ProfileManager, WorkerProfile, verification logic
   → Integration: Worker pool integration, existing system compatibility
   → Polish: Documentation, performance, end-to-end validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- **Setup Phase**: T001-T004 must complete before any implementation
- **Test Phase**: T005-T019 must complete and FAIL before T020-T056
- **Data Models**: T020-T025 block core implementation T026-T030
- **Core Profile Management**: T026-T030 block verification T031-T034
- **Platform Support**: T035-T037 required for T038-T043 integration
- **Integration**: T038-T043 required for end-to-end validation T049-T056

### Blocking Relationships
- T026 (ProfileManager init) blocks T027, T028, T029, T030
- T027 (profile cloning) blocks T038 (worker pool integration)
- T031-T034 (verification) blocks T041 (startup verification)
- T038-T043 (integration) blocks T049-T056 (validation)

- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Integration with existing EXPERIMENTAL/workers/ structure

- [x] Quickstart scenarios have validation tasks

## Notes
- Focus on EXPERIMENTAL/ subproject integration with existing worker_pool.py
- Profile cloning must not corrupt base Edge profile
- Per-worker remediation without affecting other workers
- Cross-platform support for Edge profile paths
- Comprehensive testing including failure scenarios
- Performance validation for concurrent profile operations
