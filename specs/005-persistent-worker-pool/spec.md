# Feature Specification: Persistent Worker Pool with Tab-Based Processing

**Feature Branch**: `005-persistent-worker-pool`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix: Persistent Worker Pool with Tab-Based PO Processing. Replace per-PO browser instances with a persistent worker pool. Each worker runs a long-lived browser session, processes POs in new tabs, and reuses session state."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Architecture change: replace one-shot workers with persistent pool
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: PersistentWorkerPool, Workers, Browser Sessions, PO Processing
   ‚Üí Actions: Initialize workers, process POs via tabs, maintain sessions, cleanup
   ‚Üí Data: PO queue, session state, login/cookies
   ‚Üí Constraints: 1-8 workers, profile isolation, graceful shutdown
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clearly defined in user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: configure workers ‚Üí process POs ‚Üí graceful shutdown
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí PersistentWorkerPool, Worker, BrowserSession, Tab, Profile
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details beyond necessary architectural concepts
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: When a worker's browser session crashes during PO processing, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Restart worker, then redistribute to another worker, then mark as failed
- Q: How long should workers maintain persistent browser sessions before automatic renewal or cleanup? ‚Üí A: Until batch completion - keep sessions alive for entire processing run
- Q: When should the system take action due to excessive browser memory consumption? ‚Üí A: 75% of available system RAM - adaptive based on total system memory
- Q: How should the system handle corrupted browser profiles during worker initialization or operation? ‚Üí A: Abort entire operation and require manual intervention
- Q: What is the maximum time to wait for workers to complete their current PO during graceful shutdown? ‚Üí A: 1 minute
- Q: Onde deve ser implementada a funcionalidade principal do Persistent Worker Pool? ‚Üí A: Principalmente no subprojeto EXPERIMENTAL (aproveitando infraestrutura existente)
- Q: Quais m√©tricas de observabilidade devem ser expostas durante a opera√ß√£o do worker pool? ‚Üí A: B√°sicas + Detalhadas + Completas (usu√°rio escolhe no setup interativo)
- Q: Como deve ser a transi√ß√£o do sistema atual (onde cada PO cria uma nova inst√¢ncia de browser) para o novo sistema de worker pool persistente? ‚Üí A: Substitui√ß√£o direta: implementar worker pool e remover sistema antigo
- Q: Como deve ser gerenciado o estado compartilhado entre workers (fila de POs, resultados, progresso)? ‚Üí A: Estado centralizado no processo principal + processo central designa set de POs para cada worker
- Q: Qual deve ser a estrat√©gia de balanceamento de carga entre workers quando h√° diferen√ßas na velocidade de processamento? ‚Üí A: Distribui√ß√£o est√°tica: divide POs igualmente no in√≠cio + Balanceamento adaptativo: considera hist√≥rico de performance

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user processing multiple Purchase Orders, I want the system to maintain persistent browser sessions across PO downloads so that I experience faster processing times, reduced resource consumption, and improved reliability without losing session state between downloads.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system is configured for 4 workers, **When** I start PO processing, **Then** exactly 4 persistent browser sessions are initialized and maintained throughout the entire batch
2. **Given** workers are processing POs, **When** a PO completes processing, **Then** the worker opens a new tab for the next PO without reinitializing the browser or losing login state
3. **Given** I interrupt processing with Ctrl+C, **When** the shutdown signal is received, **Then** all workers complete their current PO within 1 minute timeout, close all tabs, and shut down gracefully without orphaned processes
4. **Given** workers have been processing POs for extended periods, **When** session cookies or login tokens are still valid, **Then** subsequent POs are processed without re-authentication
5. **Given** the user selects headless mode, **When** workers are initialized, **Then** all persistent browser sessions run in headless mode consistently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a worker's browser session crashes during PO processing? ‚Üí System attempts restart of crashed worker, then redistributes failed PO to another available worker, and finally marks PO as failed if no workers available
- How does the system handle profile corruption or conflicts between workers? ‚Üí System aborts entire operation and requires manual intervention to resolve profile issues
- What occurs if signal handling conflicts arise between main process and worker processes?
- How does the system behave when browser memory consumption grows over extended sessions? ‚Üí System monitors memory usage and restarts workers when total consumption exceeds 75% of available system RAM

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST initialize a configurable number of workers (1-8) at startup that maintain persistent browser sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST clone the base browser profile once per worker during initialization, not per PO
- **FR-003**: Workers MUST process POs using new tabs within their existing browser sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement proper tab lifecycle: create tab ‚Üí process PO ‚Üí close tab ‚Üí return to main tab
- **FR-005**: Workers MUST preserve session state (login cookies, authentication) across multiple PO processing cycles
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle signals (SIGINT/SIGTERM) only in the main process to prevent conflicts
- **FR-007**: Workers MUST perform cleanup only during final shutdown, not after each individual PO
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain existing user experience for worker count selection and headless mode configuration
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure profile isolation between workers to prevent data conflicts
- **FR-010**: System MUST support graceful shutdown with coordinated cleanup across all workers
- **FR-011**: System MUST eliminate the current "one-shot worker" pattern where each PO creates new browser instances
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement the persistent worker pool primarily within the EXPERIMENTAL subproject, leveraging existing infrastructure and components
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide configurable observability levels during interactive setup: basic (worker status, PO count, errors), detailed (+ response times, memory usage, throughput), or complete (+ structured logs, distributed traces)
- **FR-014**: System MUST completely replace the current per-PO browser instantiation pattern with the persistent worker pool approach, removing legacy one-shot worker implementation
- **FR-015**: System MUST manage shared state (PO queue, results, progress) centrally in the main process, with the central process coordinating PO set distribution to individual workers
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement hybrid load balancing: initial static distribution of POs equally across workers, followed by adaptive rebalancing based on worker performance history and completion rates
- **FR-017**: System MUST implement graceful shutdown with 1 minute maximum timeout for workers to complete current PO processing before forced termination

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **PersistentWorkerPool**: Manages the lifecycle of N workers, coordinates initialization and shutdown
- **Worker**: Long-running process that maintains a browser session and processes POs via tabs
- **BrowserSession**: Persistent browser instance that stays alive across multiple PO processing cycles
- **Tab**: Short-lived browser tab created per PO, closed after processing completion
- **Profile**: Browser profile cloned once per worker during initialization for isolation
